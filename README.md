# 2048 AI
Game AI for the 2048 game based on expectimax search. The base game engine uses code from <a href="https://gist.github.com/lewisjdeane/752eeba4635b479f8bb2" _target="blank">here</a>.

- Modelled the AI player as a max player, and the computer as a chance player (picking a random open spot to place a 2-tile).
- Implemented a depth-3 game tree and the expectimax algorithm to compute decisions for the AI player.

To run the program, install the required modules and use the command: `python main.py`
